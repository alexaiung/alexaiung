Hi! I'm Alexa! 🥰

I am passionate for learning, developing solutions in Data Science and Analysis. My goal is to keep learning from datasets, create models capable of predicting patterns, and, of course, convey this through elegant visualizations for interested clients. With well-informed decisions, reality becomes capable of changing in our favor {:

Have any freelance projects in mind? [Contact me!](mailto:alexa.iung.dias@gmail.com)
